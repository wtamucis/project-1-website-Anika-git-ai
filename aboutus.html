 <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        <b>The Coastal Bistro</b> is more than just a restaurant, it’s a dream brought to life. Our goal was never just to serve food, but to create a space where <i>good meals, family, and community</i> come together by the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re a family-owned coastal restaurant built on love, hustle, and a whole lot of flavor. When we stumbled upon a quiet little spot by the shore, we didn’t just see a building, we saw the start of something special. Together, we rolled up our sleeves, put in the work, and opened the doors to what would become <b>The Coastal Bistro</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything on our menu has a story. Our <b>Cajun Chicken Pasta</b> is a family favorite. The shrimp tacos are legendary (trust us, you’ll come back for them), and our <b>key lime pie</b>? That’s the kids' proud creation. We believe food tastes better when it's made with heart, and shared with the people you love.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s why guests keep coming back:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Fresh, local ingredients</i> sourced sustainably from the coast.</li>
        <li><i>Scenic waterfront views</i> to enjoy while you dine.</li>
        <li><i>A welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere</i> where everyone feels at home.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Whether you're stopping in after a day at the beach or looking for your new favorite local spot, we hope you feel right at home here.
