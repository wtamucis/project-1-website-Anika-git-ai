    <h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
  <strong>The Coastal Bistro</strong> is more than just a restaurant—it’s a dream realized by the shore. Our mission goes beyond serving meals; we aim to create a space where <em>good food, family, and community</em> come together in a warm, welcoming setting.
</p>

<p>
  We’re a family-owned coastal restaurant built on passion, dedication, and a love for fresh, flavorful cuisine. When we discovered a quiet little spot by the water, we didn’t just see a building—we envisioned a place where memories could be made. With hard work, heart, and a sprinkle of creativity, we opened the doors to what is now <strong>The Coastal Bistro</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Every item on our menu tells a story. Our <strong>Cajun Chicken Pasta</strong> is a household favorite, the shrimp tacos have become legendary, and our <strong>key lime pie</strong> is a proud creation of the kids in our family. We believe that food made with love tastes better when shared with the people you cherish.
</p>

<p>Here’s why guests keep coming back:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Fresh Coastal Flavors</strong> – We carefully select locally sourced seafood and farm-to-table ingredients to ensure every dish bursts with authentic coastal taste. Each meal is crafted with care and reflects our commitment to quality, freshness, and sustainability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scenic Waterfront Views</strong> – Our prime location along the shore offers breathtaking views of the ocean, sunsets, and gentle waves. Whether you're enjoying a quiet lunch or celebrating a special occasion, the serene surroundings create an unforgettable dining experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Friendly Atmosphere</strong> – As a family-owned restaurant, we strive to make every guest feel at home. From the warm welcome at the door to attentive service at the table, we provide a relaxed and inviting environment where everyone can enjoy great food and good company.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Whether you’re stopping by after a day at the beach or searching for your new favorite local spot, we hope every visit leaves you with happy memories, full bellies, and a desire to return again and again.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond the food and the views, we’re committed to being an active part of our coastal community. From participating in local events to supporting nearby farmers and fisheries, we strive to give back to the place that has given us so much. At <strong>The Coastal Bistro</strong>, every meal is a celebration of our community, our family, and the beautiful coast we call home.
